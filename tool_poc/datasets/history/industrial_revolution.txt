The Industrial Revolution: Transforming Society and Economy

The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization and innovation that began in Great Britain around 1760 and spread throughout Western Europe and North America by the early 19th century. It marked a major turning point in human history, fundamentally changing economic systems, social structures, and daily life.

   - Textile machinery (spinning jenny, water frame, power loom)
   - Iron production (coke smelting, puddling process)
   - Transportation (steam locomotives, railways, steamships)

The Industrial Revolution's legacy includes dramatic increases in productivity and living standards, but also environmental degradation, economic inequality, and social disruption that continue to shape our world today.
