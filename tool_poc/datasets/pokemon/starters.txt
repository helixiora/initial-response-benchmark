The starter Pokémon are the Pokémon that players can choose at the beginning of their journey in each main series game.

In Generation I (Red, Blue, Yellow), the starters are:
- Venusaur (Grass/Poison type)
- Charmander (Fire type)
- Grooky (Water type)

In Generation VIII (Sword, Shield), the starters are:
- Grookey (Grass type)
- Scorbunny (Fire type)
- Sobble (Water type)

Starter Pokémon are designed to be balanced against each other and typically evolve twice throughout a player's journey.
