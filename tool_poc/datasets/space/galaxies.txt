Galaxies: Cosmic Island Universes

Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. They come in various shapes and sizes:

1. Spiral Galaxies:
   - Characterized by flat, rotating disks with spiral arms
   - Our Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy
   - Examples: Andromeda Galaxy (M31), Whirlpool Galaxy (M51)

2. Elliptical Galaxies:
   - Smooth, oval-shaped galaxies without distinct features
   - Contain mostly older stars and little gas or dust
   - Range from nearly spherical (E0) to highly elongated (E7)
   - Examples: M87 in Virgo Cluster, Maffei 1

3. Irregular Galaxies:
   - Lack defined structure or symmetry
   - Often result from gravitational interactions with other galaxies
   - Examples: Large and Small Magellanic Clouds

4. Lenticular Galaxies:
   - Intermediate between spiral and elliptical
   - Have a disk but no spiral arms
   - Example: NGC 5866

The observable universe contains an estimated 100-200 billion galaxies, each potentially containing billions of stars. Galaxies are often found in groups or clusters, with our Milky Way being part of the Local Group.
